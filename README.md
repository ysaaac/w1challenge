# w1challenge
The program can be tested either with just a `go run` or ideally with an executable. So we do something like:
```shell
go run main.go evenodd
```
or
```shell
./w1challenge evenodd
```

The program will know which package to execute using a CLI argument, its value could be any of this:
- evenodd
- foobar
- ohm
- bmi
- mario
